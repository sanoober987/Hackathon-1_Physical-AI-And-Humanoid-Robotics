- [X] T046 Final build validation and deployment preparation

## Dependencies

- **US2 depends on**: US1 (students need Isaac Sim foundation before Isaac ROS)
- **US3 depends on**: US2 (navigation concepts build on perception understanding)

## Parallel Execution Opportunities

- **Setup Phase**: T004 can run in parallel with other setup tasks
- **Foundational Phase**: T005 and T008 can run in parallel
- **User Story Phases**: Each chapter creation (T009, T019, T029) can start in parallel after foundational work
- **Polish Phase**: T039, T040, T042, T045 can run in parallel

## Implementation Strategy

**MVP Scope**: Complete US1 (Isaac Sim chapter) with foundational setup tasks for a minimal but educational module.

**Delivery Order**:
1. Setup and foundational tasks (T001-T008)
2. US1 - Isaac Sim chapter (T009-T018)
3. US2 - Isaac ROS chapter (T019-T028)
4. US3 - Nav2 chapter (T029-T038)
5. Polish and validation (T039-T046)

Each user story provides an independently testable and valuable learning module that builds on the previous one.
