## Dependencies

- **US2 depends on**: US1 (navigation improvements build on general styling foundation)
- **US3 depends on**: US2 (homepage benefits from consistent navigation elements)

## Parallel Execution Opportunities

- **Setup Phase**: T004 can run in parallel with other setup tasks
- **Foundational Phase**: T005 and T008 can run in parallel
- **User Story Phases**: Different component types can be developed in parallel (T009-T018 for general styling, T019-T028 for navigation, T029-T038 for homepage)
- **Polish Phase**: T039, T040, T042, T045 can run in parallel

## Implementation Strategy

**MVP Scope**: Complete US1 (Modern Documentation Interface) with foundational setup tasks for a minimal but functional UI improvement.

**Delivery Order**:
1. Setup and foundational tasks (T001-T008)
2. US1 - Modern Documentation Interface (T009-T018)
3. US2 - Improved Navigation Structure (T019-T028)
4. US3 - Enhanced Homepage Experience (T029-T038)
5. Polish and validation (T039-T046)

Each user story provides an independently testable and valuable UI improvement that builds on the previous one.
