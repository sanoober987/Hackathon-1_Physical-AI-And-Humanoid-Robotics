## Phase 5: [US3] Implement Vision-Guided Manipulation

### Goal
Create educational content on combining vision, language, and motion planning to create robots that can detect, identify, and manipulate objects based on verbal instructions.

### Independent Test
Students can implement object detection and grasp planning systems that respond to verbal commands to identify and manipulate specific objects.

### Tasks
- [X] T029 [P] [US3] Create vision-guided manipulation chapter file at docs/module-4/chapter-3.md
- [X] T030 [P] [US3] Add frontmatter to vision-guided manipulation chapter with title and description

- [X] T037 [US3] Include computer vision techniques for robotic manipulation
- [X] T038 [US3] Add troubleshooting tips for vision system integration

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Goal
Integrate all content, validate the build, and ensure consistent quality across all chapters.

### Independent Test
Complete Module 4 compiles without errors and all content is accessible and properly linked with consistent educational quality.

### Tasks
- [X] T039 [P] Review and refine all three chapter contents for consistency
- [X] T040 [P] Validate Docusaurus build with all new content included
- [X] T041 Add cross-references between related concepts in different chapters
- [X] T042 [P] Add learning objectives alignment to functional requirements
- [X] T043 Conduct final proofread of all Module 4 content
- [X] T044 Test all code examples and verify accuracy
- [X] T045 [P] Optimize content for target audience (ROS 2, perception, Python basics)
- [X] T046 Final build validation and deployment preparation

## Dependencies

- **US2 depends on**: US1 (students need voice-to-action foundation before cognitive planning)
- **US3 depends on**: US2 (vision manipulation concepts build on planning understanding)

## Parallel Execution Opportunities

- **Setup Phase**: T004 can run in parallel with other setup tasks
- **Foundational Phase**: T005 and T008 can run in parallel
- **User Story Phases**: Each chapter creation (T009, T019, T029) can start in parallel after foundational work
- **Polish Phase**: T039, T040, T042, T045 can run in parallel

## Implementation Strategy

**MVP Scope**: Complete US1 (Voice-to-Action chapter) with foundational setup tasks for a minimal but educational module.

**Delivery Order**:
1. Setup and foundational tasks (T001-T008)
2. US1 - Voice-to-Action chapter (T009-T018)
3. US2 - Cognitive Planning chapter (T019-T028)
4. US3 - Vision-Guided Manipulation chapter (T029-T038)
5. Polish and validation (T039-T046)

Each user story provides an independently testable and valuable learning module that builds on the previous one.
