  Generated comprehensive task list for FastAPI RAG Agent Integration:

  1. Created tasks.md with 6 phases:
     - Phase 1: Setup (T001-T005) - Project initialization
     - Phase 2: Foundational (T006-T011) - Core components
     - Phase 3: US1 - Query RAG System (T012-T017) - Core functionality
     - Phase 4: US2 - API Service Availability (T018-T023) - Health and error handling
     - Phase 5: US3 - Cross-Origin Support (T024-T028) - CORS configuration
     - Phase 6: Polish - Cross-cutting concerns (T029-T034)

  2. Organized tasks by user story priority (P1, P1, P2)
  3. Identified parallel execution opportunities
  4. Established dependencies between phases
  5. Defined independent test criteria for each user story
  6. Specified MVP scope (Phases 1-3) for immediate implementation

  Total: 34 individual tasks across all phases
outcome: "Complete task breakdown with proper organization, dependencies, and parallel execution opportunities."
evaluation: "Tasks are well-structured following the checklist format with proper IDs, story labels, and file paths. Ready for implementation."
